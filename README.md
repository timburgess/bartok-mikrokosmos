## Bartok's Mikrokosmos

Wikipedia has a good summary of Mikrokosmos at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikrokosmos_(Bart%C3%B3k)

Essentially these are the initial pieces in Volume 1 (Beginner Pieces) of Bartok's Mikrokosmos for piano

Each piece consists of a [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org) .ly file, the score in PDF format and a MIDI file for listening

I discovered Mikrokosmos as a very early piano player (pre-Grade 3 exam). Don't think that it alone can turn you into a late beginner
or intermediate player. A good teacher plus a lot of dedication can take you from nothing to about a Grade 3 level in
just 12 months. And they'll provide much more interesting music than Bartok's early basic pieces. Many teachers use
[Burgmuller's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Burgm%C3%BCller) 25 Easy and Progressive Studies which are
more interesting.

Mikrokosmos however is good material for working on sight-reading. You can start at the simplest level and although you'll need
quite a lot of other works, you can keep a range of pieces in a collection for a 20-25 minute sightreading exercise. The
Bartok number can give you a sense of where you are as you progress.

John Mortensen has a good overview on improving sightreading - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVMW7zo4w90&t=2s
